# Simple back-end part with frames and reacting to object intersections in JS

This repository contains a simple single-page website created for the purpose of practicing JavaScript. The website features a basic game where you control a pixel and try to avoid colliding with a moving square.

## Important note
This code is useful only for practicing the back-end part with frames and reacting to object intersections in JavaScript. 
Everything else is just meant to demonstrate that code snippet.

### How to Play
- Use the "W", "A", "S", and "D" keys to move the pink pixel.
- Avoid colliding with the pink square that moves randomly on the black canvas.
- If the pixel collides with the square, the game will end, and a link to Bing will open.

### How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Play the game using the "W", "A", "S", and "D" keys on your keyboard.


## Disclaimer
This project is meant for educational and practice purposes. The code snippet are simple and not intended for production or commercial use.
Feel free to explore the code and make changes to enhance the game or add new features. Happy coding! ðŸš€
